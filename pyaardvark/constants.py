Most API functions will throw an :exc:`IOError` in case an error is
encountered. The :attr:`errno` attribute will set to one of the following
values:

.. data:: ERR_UNABLE_TO_LOAD_LIBRARY
.. data:: ERR_UNABLE_TO_LOAD_DRIVER
.. data:: ERR_UNABLE_TO_LOAD_FUNCTION
.. data:: ERR_INCOMPATIBLE_LIBRARY
.. data:: ERR_INCOMPATIBLE_DEVICE
.. data:: ERR_COMMUNICATION_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_UNABLE_TO_OPEN
.. data:: ERR_UNABLE_TO_CLOSE
.. data:: ERR_INVALID_HANDLE
.. data:: ERR_CONFIG_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_I2C_NOT_AVAILABLE
.. data:: ERR_I2C_NOT_ENABLED
.. data:: ERR_I2C_READ_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_I2C_WRITE_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_I2C_SLAVE_BAD_CONFIG
.. data:: ERR_I2C_SLAVE_READ_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_I2C_SLAVE_TIMEOUT
.. data:: ERR_I2C_DROPPED_EXCESS_BYTES
.. data:: ERR_I2C_BUS_ALREADY_FREE
.. data:: ERR_SPI_NOT_AVAILABLE
.. data:: ERR_SPI_NOT_ENABLED
.. data:: ERR_SPI_WRITE_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_SPI_SLAVE_READ_ERROR
.. data:: ERR_SPI_SLAVE_TIMEOUT
.. data:: ERR_SPI_DROPPED_EXCESS_BYTES

The functions :meth:`Aardvark.i2c_slave_read`, :meth:`Aardvark.i2c_master_read`
and :meth:`Aardvark.i2c_master_write` will throw an :exc:`IOError` with its
:attr:`errno` attribute set to a status code to indicate the state of the I2C
transaction in case of an error.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_OK

    No error occured.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_BUS_ERROR

    A bus error has occured. Transaction was aborted.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_SLA_ACK

    Bus arbitration was lost during master transation; another master on the
    bus has successfully addressed this Aardvark adapter's slave address. As a
    result, this Aardvark adapter has automatically switched to slave mode and
    is responding.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_SLA_NACK

    The Aardvark adapter failed to receive acknowledgement for the requested
    slave address during a master operation.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_DATA_NACK

    The last data byte in the transaction was not acknowledged by the slave.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_ARB_LOST

    I2C master arbitration lost, because another master on the bus was
    accessing the bus simultaneously.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_BUS_LOCKED

    An I2C packet is in progress and the time since the last I2C event executed
    or received on the bus has exceeded the bus lock timeout. This is most
    likely due to the clock line of the bus being held low by some other device
    or due to the data line held low such that a start condition cannot be
    executed by the Aardvark adapter. The bus lock timeout can be configured
    using the :attr:`Aardvark.i2c_bus_timeout` property. The Aardvark adapter
    resets its own I2C interface when a timeout is observed and no further
    action is taken on the bus.

.. data:: I2C_STATUS_LAST_DATA_ACK

    The last byte was ACK'ed by the opposing master. When the Aardvark slave is
    configured with a fixed length transmit buffer, it will detach itself from
    the I2C bus after the buffer is fully transmitted and the aardvark slave
    also expects that the last byte sent from this buffer is NACK'ed by the
    opposing master device.
